## 1. How to create a Rich Presence application with discord
- First you need to go on https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
- There you need to create an application **the name of your application will be displayed on discord as is playing [the name of your application you just created]**
- Enable rich presence for your app and add some assets
## 2. Download these files
- Click on Code and download as ZIP file
## 3. Edit the config files
- Edit the config file with the information you just edited in your application
- Run the Custom Discord RP.exe file **if there are some errors, it should display them**
- If you did all these steps correctly Discord should display it as a game, if not, add the exe as a game on discord and the file path should change to your presence

**You can edit the config any time while the program is running to change the presence (make sure to save the file)**
